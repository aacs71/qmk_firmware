# Keychron Q1 keymap ISO Portuguese - Portugal

This ISO layout got heavily inspired by kubahorak work (rev_0102).

Features:
- The rightest key column is: *PgUp, PgDn, Home, End* which differs from the default.
- RGB lighting turns off when the computer sleeps
- Caps Lock and alpha keys turn red to indicate when Caps Lock is on
- When the Fn layer is active, RGB lighting turns off for keys that are not assigned
